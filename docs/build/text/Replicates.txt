Description of the Replicates class
***********************************

class Replicates.Replicates

   Has data from muliple trajectories with the same input, but
   different  random seeds and possibly different initial states

   AverageRuns()

      Average multiple trajectories

   BuildJobFiles(init_states=[])

      Builds folders with Zacros input files. The only difference is
      the random seed.

   ComputeSA(product, window=[0.0, 1.0])

      Perform sensitivity analysis

   FD_SA(rxn_inds=[1], pert_frac=0.05, n_runs=20, setup=True, exec_run=True, analyze_bool=True)

      Perform finite difference sensitivity analysis

   PlotSensitivities()

      Plot the results of sensitivity analysis

   ReadMultipleRuns()

      Read all Zacros jobs in a given folder

   RunAllJobs_parallel_JobArray(max_cores=100, server='Squidward')

      Runs a job array on Squidward or Farber

   RunAllJobs_serial()

      Runs all Zacros jobs in serial

   WriteSA_output()

      Write the results of sensitivity analysis into an SA_output.txt

   static time_sandwich(batch1, batch2)

      Append two sets of trajectories
